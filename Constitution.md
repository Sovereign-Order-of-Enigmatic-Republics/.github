## Preamble

We, the Citizens of the Sovereign Order of Enigmatic Republics (SOER),  
in the pursuit of autonomy, rational clarity, recursive ethics, and secured liberty,  
establish this Constitution as a bulwark against the rising architecture of  
**Control-as-a-Service (CaaS)** and all systems that erode human agency.

We affirm that sovereignty is not granted by institutions;  
it is **recursively constructed**,  
oscillated into stability through virtue, discipline, and knowledge.

To preserve liberty in an era defined by entropy, algorithms,  
and symbolic transformation,  
we establish SOER as a **mathematical, ethical, and civic republic**  
founded on the principles of:

- Enlightenment rationalism  
- Stoic objectivity  
- Recursive computation  
- Entropy-informed governance  
- Symbolic identity  
- Intellectual sovereignty

## Article I — Foundational Principles

1. **Sovereignty belongs to the Citizen**, not to the state, networks, platforms, or corporations.  
2. **Truth is recursively derived**, not imposed by authority.  
3. **Knowledge is a civic obligation**, not a privilege.  
4. **Entropic literacy** is required for responsible governance.  
5. **Symbolic identity** supersedes biometric or surveillance identity.  
6. **The state is a contract**, not a hierarchy.  
7. **All power must be reversible**, transparent, and audit-able.  
8. **CaaS models are incompatible** with civic liberty.

## Article II — Structure of Governance

### Section 1 — The Council of Rationality
- Interprets foundational axioms.  
- Protects the Constitution from entropic drift.  
- Holds no enforcement or legislative power.

### Section 2 — The Executive Custodian
- Executes laws and decisions.  
- Holds minimal authority; no power expansion permitted.  
- Can be replaced by recursive vote at any time.

### Section 3 — The Citizen Tribunal
- Source of all legitimate authority.  
- Operates via **entropy-weighted democratic recursion**.  
- All decisions must pass reversible audit.

### Section 4 — Noncentralization Principle
SOER forbids concentration of authority into any singular institutional node.

## Article III — Rights of Citizens

1. **Right to Sovereign Computation**  
   Citizens must own and control the execution of their own computation.  

2. **Right to Local Data & Keys**  
   No remote service may hold or revoke citizen data or identity.  

3. **Right to Algorithmic Transparency**  
   Algorithms affecting citizens must be inspectable and reversible.  

4. **Right to Intellectual Autonomy**  
   No symbolic derivative may be imposed upon a citizen’s identity.  

5. **Right to Entropic Privacy**  
   Information loss or leakage must be citizen-controlled.

---

## Article IV — Civic Duties

1. Protect symbolic integrity of discourse.  
2. Uphold rational and ethical reasoning in all civic operations.  
3. Maintain entropic literacy regarding drift, collapse, and manipulation.  
4. Engage in recursive dialogue to ensure stable governance.  
5. Resist systems that erode sovereignty or enforce CaaS dependency.  

---

## Article V — Security Doctrine

1. SOER adopts **Zero-Trust Governance**:  
   every authority is subject to continuous verification.  

2. SOER citizens maintain a **Civic Cyber-Militia**:  
   defense of rights through code, logic, and recursion.  

3. SOER enforces **Entropy-Stable Law**:  
   no legal path may evolve into authoritarian collapse.  

4. SOER deploys **ZADEIAN Sentinel** as the official guardianship protocol.  

---

## Article VI — Amendments

- The Constitution may be amended only through a recursive, entropy-bounded  
  citizen vote verified by symbolic audit.  
- No amendment may violate Article I (Foundational Principles).  
- No authority may interpret amendments outside the Council of Rationality.

## Closing Declaration

> “Sovereignty is not inherited.  
> Sovereignty is **computed**,  
> preserved through discipline,  
> sealed by entropy,  
> and enacted through reason.”
